## 📌 Overview

**SecurBank** is a fully functional, bank-grade **Core Banking Management System (CBS)** implemented in pure C. It simulates the backend engine of a real financial institution — handling account lifecycle management, multi-type transaction processing, a cryptographically-protected authentication system, an append-only transaction ledger, and a structured administrative control plane.

Built without any external libraries or database engines, SecurBank demonstrates how production-grade financial systems architect their persistence, security, and business logic layers — using only the C standard library and disciplined software engineering.

> **This is not a toy project.** Every design decision — from atomic file writes to per-record checksums to PIN-stretch hashing — reflects patterns used in actual banking infrastructure.

### Why This Matters

| Concern | SecurBank's Approach |
|---|---|
| **Data Integrity** | Per-record DJB2 checksums detect file tampering at load time |
| **Persistence** | Atomic rename-based writes prevent DB corruption on crash |
| **Authentication** | 4096-round PIN stretch hashing with per-account random salts |
| **Auditability** | Structured, timestamped, append-only audit log for every action |
| **Concurrency Safety** | Session tokens, activity timeouts, and re-authentication gates |
| **Separation of Concerns** | 9 fully decoupled modules with clean header-defined interfaces |

---

## ✨ Features

### 👤 User Module
- **Account Registration** — Open Savings, Current, or Salary accounts with full KYC fields
- **Secure Login** — Account ID + PIN authentication with session token generation
- **Real-time Balance** — Live balance with daily transaction utilization tracking
- **Cash Deposit** — Single-transaction and daily-limit-enforced deposits
- **Cash Withdrawal** — PIN-gated withdrawals with balance and limit validation
- **Fund Transfer** — Account-to-account transfers with real-time debit/credit ledgering
- **Mini Statement** — Last 10 transactions retrieved from the append-only binary ledger
- **PIN Management** — Secure PIN change with old-PIN verification and format enforcement

### 🧑‍💼 Admin Module
- **Account Directory** — Paginated, balance-sorted view of all accounts in the system
- **Multi-mode Search** — Lookup by Account ID, partial name match, or audit log keyword
- **Account Detail View** — Full profile + inline mini-statement for any account
- **Freeze / Unfreeze** — Reversible account suspension with audit trail
- **Secure Deletion** — Hard-delete with mandatory admin PIN re-authentication and confirmation gate
- **PIN Lock Reset** — Unlock accounts with forced PIN reassignment
- **Batch Interest** — Apply monthly compounded interest across all eligible accounts in one operation
- **System Analytics** — Real-time dashboard: account counts by status/type, total funds, deposit/withdrawal volumes
- **Audit Log Viewer** — Tail or keyword-search the full structured audit trail

### 🔐 Security Module
- **PIN Hashing** — Custom 4096-round DJB2 stretch function with per-account random salt (XOR + fold mixing)
- **Account Lockout** — Automatic lock after 3 consecutive failed PIN attempts
- **Session Management** — In-memory session tokens with 15-minute inactivity timeout
- **Re-authentication Gates** — Sensitive operations (withdraw, transfer, delete) require live PIN re-entry
- **Record Checksums** — Every `Account` struct carries a computed integrity checksum validated on DB load
- **Database Header Integrity** — Magic bytes, version field, and header checksum protect the binary DB file
- **Atomic Writes** — All DB saves write to a `.tmp` file first, then atomically rename — crash-safe
- **Input Sanitization** — All user input is length-clamped, control-character stripped, and type-validated
- **Trivial PIN Rejection** — Hardcoded blocklist rejects `0000`, `1234`, `123456`, and similar sequences

### 📊 Advanced System Features
- **Append-Only Transaction Ledger** — Binary log file; records are never modified, only appended
- **Transaction Checksums** — Every ledger record carries its own integrity signature
- **Interest Calculation Engine** — Type-aware monthly interest: Savings (3.5%), Salary (4.0%), Current (0%)
- **Daily Limit Enforcement** — Per-account-type rolling daily transaction caps reset at midnight
- **Account Balance Consistency** — Dual-field tracking (`total_deposited` vs `total_withdrawn`) for reconciliation
- **Structured Audit Logging** — Actor, action, target, timestamp, and severity level on every log entry
- **Balance-sorted Reporting** — Admin account list uses in-place selection sort by balance descending
- **System Analytics Engine** — Aggregated financial metrics computed live from in-memory account state

## 🏗 System Architecture

SecurBank is designed around a **strict layered architecture** with unidirectional dependencies. No lower layer knows about any higher layer.

        │
        ▼
  acct_withdraw()         ← validates amount, daily limit, balance
        │
        ▼
   txn_record()           ← appends record to binary ledger
        │
        ▼
  db_save_accounts()      ← atomic write to accounts.dat
        │
        ▼
   log_audit()            ← structured entry written to audit.log

## 🛠 Technologies Used

| Technology | Usage |
|---|---|
| **C99** | Core language; chosen for system-level control and performance |
| **GCC / GNU Make** | Compilation toolchain with strict warning flags (`-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic`) |
| **Binary File I/O** | `fread` / `fwrite` for structured binary account and transaction records |

## 🔐 Security Design

### PIN Protection Pipeline

```
User PIN ("7291")
      │
      ▼
sec_generate_salt()     → 16-char random salt per account (stored)
      │
      ▼
sec_hash_pin()          → salt + PIN + salt → 4096 rounds of DJB2 stretch
      │                   XOR mixing + fold → 32-char hex digest
      ▼
stored in Account.pin_hash (never stored in plaintext, ever)
```

### Integrity Verification Pipeline

```
accounts.dat loaded
      │
      ▼
DBHeader verified       → magic (0x42414E4B) + version + header checksum
      │
      ▼
Per-record checksum     → each Account struct checksum verified on read
      │
      ▼
Tampered records        → skipped + logged as CRITICAL in system.log
```

### Session Security Model

```
Successful Login
      │
      ├─ Session token generated (32-char random hex)
      ├─ Login timestamp recorded
      ├─ 15-minute inactivity timer started
      │
      ▼
Each sensitive operation
      ├─ auth_is_authenticated() — checks session active + not expired
      └─ auth_reauth(pin) — for withdraw / transfer / delete operations
```

### Security Checklist

- [x] Passwords (PINs) never stored in plaintext
- [x] Per-account unique salt prevents rainbow table attacks
- [x] Key-stretching (4096 rounds) slows brute-force attempts
- [x] Account lockout after 3 failed attempts
- [x] Session timeout after 15 minutes of inactivity
- [x] Re-authentication required for all financial transactions
- [x] All user input sanitized before processing
- [x] Trivial PIN blocklist enforced at registration and change
- [x] Database file integrity verified on every startup
- [x] All security events logged with actor, timestamp, and severity

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Account Lifecycle

```
Registration → PIN Setup → Account Created → Active
                                               │
                              ┌────────────────┼────────────────┐
                              ▼                ▼                ▼
                           Deposit         Withdraw          Transfer
                              │                │                │
                              └────────────────┴────────────────┘
                                               │
                                    Ledger Entry Written
                                    Balance Updated
                                    Daily Limit Tracked
                                    Audit Log Entry Written
                                    DB Atomically Saved
```

### Transaction Limits

| Account Type | Daily Limit | Interest Rate | Min Balance |
|---|---|---|---|
| Savings | ₹50,000 | 3.5% p.a. | ₹500 |
| Current | ₹2,00,000 | 0% | ₹500 |
| Salary | ₹1,00,000 | 4.0% p.a. | ₹500 |

### Interest Calculation

```
Monthly Interest = (Account Balance × Annual Rate%) / 12
Applied via: Admin Panel → Apply Monthly Interest (All Accounts)
Recorded as: TXN_INTEREST entry in the transaction ledger
```
